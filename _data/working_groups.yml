  title: "CT for ML"
  leader: bungert
  co-leader: guy
  description: "The advent of the control theoretic perspective on learning with deep residual neural networks has
recently been shown to be not only a reliable computational tool, but also a fruitful avenue for
providing original theoretical results to a multitude of problems. These include adversarial
robustness, generative modelling and generalisation bounds, to name a few. Similarly, dynamic
Bayesian networks, which are the central paradigm in statistical ML, can be analysed with the help of
classical CT tools like Kalman filters. The aim is to explore these connections and contribute to the
mathematics of reliable ML."
  tasks:
    - "Obtaining error estimates for ML surrogates"
    - "Theoretical guarantees for physics-informed neural networks"
    - "Application of Game Theory to ML"
    - "Kalman filters in statistical ML"
    - "Analysis of high-dimensional deep neural networks and transformers using CT tools"

  title: "ML for CT"
  leader: kleikamp
  co-leader: periago
  description: "This working group addresses the application of ML tools, such as kernel methods and deep neural networks
to complex models in control theory. These will be combined with traditional control methods, either on
the algorithmic level for developing enhanced and provably efficient novel techniques, or for analysis
purposes, in order to better understand the opportunities and limitations of ML for the control design.
The focus will be on the development of techniques that can handle high-dimensional problems and
face the curse of dimensionality."
  tasks:
    - "Addressing the curse of dimensionality with ML tools"
    - "Solving parameterised optimal control problems"
    - "Construction of control Lyapunov functions using ML methods"
    - "Developing ML-based approaches for the for the life-cycle-optimisation in materials"
    - "Exploiting PINNs for solving complex free boundary problems"

  title: "Hybrid and Data-driven modelling"
  leader: flasskamp
  co-leader: gruene
  description: "The aim is to address control problems built on observed pairs of input-output data. The Action will
develop efficient and reliable methods for designing controllers when the underlying model is
unidentified or when the underlying laws and processes only allow partial knowledge. While these topics
arise in a wide range of potential applications, the Action will focus on control of power systems (solar,
wind, smart houses) and construction of digital twins in healthcare and personalised medicine. In
connection with industry partners, the Action will explore implementation options that can provide
benefits for clean energy and improve healthcare outcomes of European citizens."
  tasks:
    - "Approximating the (control to) state law from data"
    - "Constructive methods for extremum seeking control"
    - "Control of energy systems"
    - "Digital twins for personalised medicine"

  title: "Transformational activities"
  leader: jacimovic
  co-leader: dede
  description: "WG4 will be responsible for transforming theoretical results into software solutions and practical
implementations in industry and society. Its activities are essential for bridging the gap between theory
and real-world applications, ultimately ensuring the relevance and accessibility of the findings to the
broader community. Special attention will be given the following activities: <ul><li>creating an open-source
repository hosting solutions related to the theoretical advances from WG1-WG3;</li><li>development of
comprehensive documentation and training materials (tutorials, case studies, etc);</li><li>establishing
partnership with industry to promote the adoption of these solutions and validate their applicability.</li></ul>"
  tasks:
    - "Identify possible real-world applications of the results gained in WG1-WG3 in collaboration with
industrial partners."
    - "Establish a public repository for data, coding and programs (on GitHub or a similar platform) in
accordance with the FAIR data principles."
    - "Develop comprehensive documentation and training materials (tutorials, case studies, etc)."
    - "Identify and pursue funding opportunities that facilitate collaborations between scientists and
industry stakeholders."
    - "Organise on-site events linking companies, software developers and researchers (at least two
such events per the Action lifetime)."

  title: "Sharing & spreading"
  leader: caldarelli
  co-leader: molinari
  description: "The aim of WG5 is to provide communication channels that will allow for efficient and timely transfer of
knowledge among Action members and towards a wider audience. In particular, to produce a dynamic
overview of the progress achieved and the current state of the art (the results, developed codes, open
problems, industrial perspectives) that will be immediately available to the other WGs, and later to all
the interested researchers. Special attention will be paid to the problems of fragmentation of
communities interested in CT, ML and their applications. This WG will help to tackle the challenge that
the same or closely related problems/methods are known by different communities under different
names, and cross-references are not clearly established."
  tasks:
    - "Develop an online platform for sharing the results and ideas of the researchers involved in the
Action, both within and beyond the Action."
    - "Provide a forum for discussion and communication to be used by all Action members."
    - "Launch and run on a regular basis an (online) seminar of the Action."
    - "Provide a list of open problems that will be offered to Master and Ph.D. students, and to Young
Researchers and Innovators participating in the network."
    - "Establish a platform offering industry related internships to Master and Ph.D. students."
    - "Disseminate results via social media."
    - "Organise participation in popular science activities at local, national and international level
(public lectures, Open Doors events, European Researchers Night, Science festivals, etc.)."
